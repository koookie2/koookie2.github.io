I'm a high school student from Virginia. I go to Academies of Loudoun and Broadrun High. My interest and passion is computer science, specifically machine learning and AI.

# Projects
### Enhancing Machine Learning Interpretability with the SHAP Algorithm
For my senior year research paper at the Academies of Loudoun, I explored my passion for machine learning and neural networks. A major challenge in this field is the "black box" nature of neural networks, which can make their use in sensitive areas like healthcare problematic due to a lack of transparency. My paper addresses this issue by focusing on methods to improve interpretability. In particular, I examine how neural networks can analyze MRI scans to detect Alzheimer's disease, and how SHAP algorithms can be used to provide clear explanations for their decisions.

### Summer Internship
TBD

### Cognitive screening exam based on SLUMS methodology
I developed a mobile app that can be used to screen for cognitive fitness and early onset of Alzheimer's disease. Please download and check it out for yourself. This is my first foray into writing mobile apps.

### DNS checker for genes in DNA sequence
TBD

### NASA / VASTS Internship
Aerospace, spaceships, and robotics are passionate topics of mine. I had the high privilege to participate in the VASTS program and fortunate enough to be in the selective group that participated in an internship program at NASA Langley Research Center. 

# Hobbies and Activities

### Cybersages an FTC team
I'm the lead programmer for this wonderful FTC team. We have fun and have participated in the last three years in FTC competitions around Virginia.

### Varsity Crew
I am part of the varsity crew team in my high school Broadrun. I row at the third position and have been a state finalist in 2024.

### Cyber Patriots competition
I participate in CyberPatriots, a prestigious national high school cybersecurity competition where teams of four students work together to identify and resolve security vulnerabilities in simulated network environments. This competition has strengthened my technical skills in network security, system administration, and problem-solving under pressure.

### Computer Science Competititons
TBD
