I'm a high school student from Virginia. I go to Academies of Loudoun. My interest and passion is computer science, specifically machine learning and AI.

# Projects
### Enhancing Machine Learning Interpretability with the SHAP Algorithm
For my senior year research paper at the Academies of Loudoun, I explored my passion for machine learning and neural networks. A major challenge in this field is the "black box" nature of neural networks, which can make their use in sensitive areas like healthcare problematic due to a lack of transparency. My paper addresses this issue by focusing on methods to improve interpretability. In particular, I examine how neural networks can analyze MRI scans to detect Alzheimer's disease, and how SHAP algorithms can be used to provide clear explanations for their decisions.

### Summer Internship


### Cognitive screening exam based on SLUMS methodology
I developed a mobile app that can be used to screen for cognitive fitness and early onset of Alzheimer's disease. Please download and check it out for yourself. This is my first foray into writing mobile apps.

### DNS checker for genes in DNA sequence
TBD

### NASA / VASTS Internship
Aerospace, spaceships, and robotics are passionate topics of mine. I had the high privilege to participate in the VASTS program and fortunate enough to be in the selective group that participated in an internship program at NASA Langley Research Center.
